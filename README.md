# F8 User Interface

Welcome to the F8 UI repository! This repository contains the source code for a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts based on the original website: https://fullstack.edu.vn/. It provides a platform for users to share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences mostly about information technology with a wide audience.

As have said, this is just a clone blog website built with the **purpose of studying**. Therefore, it isn't a great place for developers to get interact with others as there aren't many active users in the app.

## Features

Cloned F8 application offers the following features:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create an account, log in, and log out securely. This ensures that only authorized users can create and manage blog posts.

2. **Blog Post Management**: Authenticated users can create new blog posts, edit existing ones, delete unwanted posts and also react to others' posts. Each blog post can have a title, content, author information, and a timestamp.

3. **Responsive Design**: The web app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. *But it isn't recommended to write blog in small devices.*


## Technologies

The F8 web app utilizes a combination of powerful technologies to deliver a robust and immersive user experience.

- **React**: core technology used to build the user interface of the F8 web app.
- **Redux**: employed for state management in the F8 web app.
- **Firebase Authentication**: ensures secure and seamless user registration, login, and user management features.
- **@tippyjs/react**: implement animated popups and modals.
- **@uiw/react-md-editor**: enable the creation of a Markdown editor for composing new blog posts and also view posts.

## Deployments

- **Netlify**: is utilized to deploy the front-end application of the F8 web app.
- **Render**: is employed to deploy the ExpressJS back-end application of the F8 web app.
- **Clever Cloud**: is used to host the production MySQL database for the F8 web app.

It's important to note that while these deployment services are *free*, there may be limitations in terms of performance, cache, and bandwidth. As a result, the application's speed and responsiveness may be affected, leading to occasional slowness. It's advisable to keep these limitations in mind when using the F8 web app and understand that the free tier of these services may have certain restrictions.

## Last word

The creator of this app is still a student and this app also is built for just studying purpose, instead of any financial income. Therefore, this repository is public for web developers' community. 

If you see any performance solution or security problems related to this app, you can interact with me through [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ch.phuc2909/). Thanks for reading these words!
